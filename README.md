# Snake-Water-Gun_Game
This game is similar to the classic Stone, Paper, Scissors we used to play as kids. However, instead of playing with a friend, your opponent this time is the computer. In this game, if you pick Snake against Water, Snake wins because it drinks the water. If you choose Gun against Snake, Gun wins because it can shoot the snake, and so on.
